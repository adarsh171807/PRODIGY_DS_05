Project Description: Analyzing Traffic Accident Data
Objective:
The project analyzes traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day, with the goal of visualizing accident hotspots and contributing factors.

Approach:

Weather Conditions: Analyzing how different weather conditions (Clear, Rainy, Foggy) affect accident frequency and fatalities.

Road Conditions: Identifying the impact of road conditions (Fine, Rough, Under Construction) on accidents.

Time of Day: Studying how accidents vary by time (Morning, Afternoon, Night).

Reasons for Accidents: Exploring major accident causes (e.g., Drunk Driving, Weather Conditions).

Accident Hotspots: Identifying states with high accident frequencies.

Contributing Factors: Visualizing the relationships between weather, road conditions, and accident timing.

Key Insights:

Weather: Foggy and rainy weather are linked to more fatalities.

Road Conditions: Construction zones and rough roads correlate with higher fatalities.

Timing: Night accidents show more fatalities due to low visibility.

Contributing Factors: Drunk driving and weather conditions are major causes.

Hotspots: States with high accident frequencies identified.

Roles:
 Led data analysis, visualized accident patterns, and derived actionable insights to improve traffic safety.

Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebooks.
